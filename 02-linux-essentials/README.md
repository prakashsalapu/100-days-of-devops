# 🐧 Day 2 – Linux Basics

Welcome to **Day 2** of my #100DaysOfDevOps challenge!  
Today, I dived into **Linux Fundamentals** - the backbone of DevOps.  

## 📚 What I Learned Today
- ✅ What is **Linux** & its importance in DevOps
- ✅ **History** of Linux (Linus Torvalds, UNIX roots)
- ✅ **Linux architecture** (Kernel, Shell, Utilities, File System)
- ✅ **Core components** – Kernel, Shell, Command-Line Tools
- ✅ **Linux distributions** – Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, etc.
- ✅ **Basic commands**:
  - `pwd`- Show present working directory  
  - `whoami`- Display current user  
  - `ls -l, ls -a, ls -h`- List files with details  
  - `touch`- Create empty file  
  - `cat`- View file contents  
  - `cd`- Change directory  
  - `chmod`- Change file permissions  



## 🖥️ Practical Hands-On
- Created a **directory** for practice: `mkdir devops_day2`
- Learned **file permission basics** with:
  ```bash
  chmod 600 .config
  ```
🔑 This secured the file so only I (owner) can read/write it.
- Verified my current location with:
  ```bash
  pwd
  ```
- and confirmed my username with:
  ```bash
  whoami
  ```
