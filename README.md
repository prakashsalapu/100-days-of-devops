# 💻 100 Days of DevOps

Welcome to my **#100DaysOfDevOps** journey! 🚀  
This repo is a **central hub** for my DevOps learning roadmap, documenting every skill, tool, and practice I’m mastering over 100 days.  

Whether you’re a beginner or looking to organize your DevOps learning path, this repo can serve as a **reference roadmap**.  



## 📚 My DevOps Roadmap

I’m dividing DevOps learning into **practical modules**, each with its **dedicated repository**.  
Here’s the roadmap so far:



1. **[Linux for DevOps](https://github.com/prakashsalapu/linux-for-devops.git)**  
   - Linux fundamentals, setup, folder structure, users & groups, file permissions, process management, monitoring, disk management.

2. **[Networking for DevOps](https://github.com/prakashsalapu/networking-for-devops.git)**  
   - IP configuration, connectivity tests, routing, active connections, bandwidth monitoring, network troubleshooting.

3. **More Modules Coming Soon…**  
   - Git, Docler, CI/CD, Kubernetes, Monitoring & Logging (Prometheus, Grafana) and more.



## 🛠 How to Use This Repo

1. Start from the **Linux for DevOps** module if you’re a complete beginner.  
2. Follow the modules in the roadmap order to build a strong foundation.  
3. Each module repo contains **hands-on exercises, commands, examples, and notes**.  
4. Practice daily - DevOps is best learned by doing!
